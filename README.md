# quicksort-radixsort

An implementation of the quicksort and radixsort algorithms with a function to compare the speed of these two sorts.

The radixsort algorithm implements the use of another sort, counting sort as part of its process.

Included in this file are also test functions to make sure that the sorting functions works as expected.
